          <h1>How is the Madingley community organized?</h1>
        </div>


        <p>
        Madingley was originally developed by a small Cambridge-based team. As the community grows, we are finding new ways to coordinate the development of the model and to communicate and collaborate. There is no lead Madingley developer, as people are free to take the model in whatever direction they wish. However, <a href="http://unep-wcmc.org" target="_blank">UNEP-WCMC</a> acts as a community convenor and coordinator of a community version of the model to ensure contributions from developers can be integrated effectively and so allow Madingley to collectively develop greater sophistication and utility. A Madingley mailing list can be signed up to here <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/friends-of-madingley" target="_blank">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/friends-of-madingley</a>.
